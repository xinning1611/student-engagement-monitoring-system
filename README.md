## Project Description
1. To identify FACS-coded facial expression datasets with emotions captured in the wild. 
2. To propose an emotion mapping algorithm using FACS codes to produce new classes of 
emotions from a standard facial expression dataset captured in the wild that are suitable for student 
engagement monitoring. 
3. To evaluate the performance of the generated dataset using any suitable deep learning models 
in terms of accuracy as well as computing speed for real-time application in a large classroom.
